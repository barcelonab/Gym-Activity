**Among all my personal projects, this is my favorite. I created this report when I found out that the Puente Hills location, where I workout was going to close. So, I thought of making a report to show the busiest locations and provide detailed insights into member workouts for effective decision-making across all branches.
For the Data Source, I created a table on Azure SQL Database. The Data I entered is according to my observation every time I worked out. Including the Month, time and the age of the members.**

**My Analysis Provided the following**

- Shows the Total Number of workouts by Location. Management will be able to identify the locations that need attention especially to those location that has less visits.
- Insights of members by age group. Through this, Management can determine which machines and equipment are needed.
- A summary of workouts by time group, enabling management to plan appropriate training sessions for specific time periods.
- With the busiest times identified, management can plan staff allocation per shift, optimize electricity consumption and make the cleaning schedule more efficiently for financial purposes.

**Here are the steps taken to complete the analysis**

- Created a Server and Database on Azure Portal.
- Added table and entered data using Azure SQL Database.
- Used the Table as Data Source on Power BI Get Data.
- Created a Date Table and marked it as Date Table.
- Grouped Time and Age for clear insights.
- Created several DAX measures for the desired metrics.
- Published, Administered and created an App in Power BI Service for end users and business stakeholders.
